# Welcome to the One and only UdaciRacer Simulation Game

## Project Introduction

This project simulates a car-race game using JavaScript Asynchronous Programming.


The game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)

3. The race results view

## Starter Code


1. An API. The API is provided in the form of a binary held in the bin folder. This pre-built API will create the race selected by the players and return a stream of information lasting the duration of the race, resulting in a final ranking of racers.

2. HTML Views.The final output will be a HTML View with an Accelerator Button , which the user clicks to start the race.
The column called LeaderBoard will keep updating the positions of the Racers and a progress bar will indicate the percentage time for all the racers in the game. The End result will be a view with the LeaderBoard showing the order of the racers positions and the progress Bar update for each racer.

## Getting Started

In order to build this game, we need to run two things: the game engine API and the front end.

### Start the Server

The game engine has been compiled down to a binary so that you can run it on any system. Because of this, you cannot edit the API in any way, it is just a black box that we interact with via the API endpoints.

To run the server, locate your operating system and run the associated command in your terminal at the root of the project.

| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |

If you are on an older OS and the above command doesn't run for you - or if you know that you are running a 32bit system - add `-32` to the end of the file name. For reference, here are the same commands but for a 32-bit system.

| 32 Bit Systems Only!  | Command to start the API                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx-32`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-32.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux-32` |

Note that this process will use your terminal tab, so you will have to open a new tab and navigate back to the project root to start the front end.

#### WINDOWS USERS -- Setting Environment Variables
If you are using a windows machine:
1. `cd` into the root of the project containing data.json
2. Run the following command to add the environment variable:
```set DATA_FILE=./data.json```

If you still run into issues running the API server on your machine, you can run this project in the Udacity classroom.


### Start the Frontend

First, run your preference of `npm install && npm start` or `yarn && yarn start` at the root of this project. Then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000.
